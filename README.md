These scripts now require PowerShell 7.4+. PowerShell 7 is the preferred method because .NET 7 has better certificate support, which guarantees better accuracy. Legacy Windows PowerShell 5.1 will only work with the legacy validation cmdlet.

## NOTE

This script is in beta and not fully validated. Results are currently not guaranteed to be accurate. Though they should be accurate when using PowerShell 7.
